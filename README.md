# BankSimulation

This is going to be an interactive BankingSimulation software where users will have
the ability to deposit money (with intrest), take out loans, open up new bank accounts, etc.

Further expansion of this project is to include basic Stock Investment simulation where users will have the ability to "invest" in stocks, where real-time prices will be retreived through an API.

Implementing a graphical interface is also being considered at this time.
